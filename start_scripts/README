Here a some scripts to start sendmailanalyzer at boot time or manually.

Standard System V startup script, should works on all distibution using
the init SysV:

	rc.sendmailanalyzer

just copy as root this script into /etc/init.d/sendmailanalyzer and
make it executable (chmod 755). If you want sendmailanalyzer to be
run at boot time and stopped at poweroff, you have to create the
corresponding symlinks into /etc/rc3.d/, /etc/rc6.d/ and /etc/rc0.d/.

For convenience, there's also a starter script for RedHat like system:

	sendmailanalyzer

Just copy as root this script into /etc/init.d/sendmailanalyzer and
make it executable (chmod 755). If you want sendmailanalyzer to be
run at boot time and stopped at poweroff, you have to run the following
command:

	chkconfig --add sendmailanalyzer

Some new distributions like last version of Fedora have replaced the
standard init SysV by the new systemd linux centrics startup system.
If you are using this system here is the service definition to use:

	sendmailanalyzer.service

just copy it under /usr/lib/systemd/system/sendmailanalyzer.service
as root. Edit it to change the path to the sendmailanalyzer program
and reload systemd with the following command as root:

	systemctl --system daemon-reload

To start/stop sendmailanalyer use the following commands:

	systemctl start sendmailanalyzer.service
	systemctl stop sendmailanalyzer.service

If you want sendmailanalyzer to be run at boot time and stopped at
poweroff, you have to run the following command:

	systemctl enable sendmailanalyzer.service
	
This will create the symlinks for you into the /etc/systemd/system/
directory.
